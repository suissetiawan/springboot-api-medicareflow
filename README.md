**MediCareFlow** is a production-ready backend API for a medical consultation booking system. Built with Domain-Driven Design principles in mind, it provides a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for managing doctors, patients, schedules, and appointments.

This project was developed to demonstrate advanced backend engineering skills, focusing on architectural best practices, secure authentication flows, and automated scheduling logic. It is designed to be lightweight enough for deployment on a personal mini-server while maintaining enterprise-grade structural integrity.
